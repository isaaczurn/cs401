            Welcome to steam FYI!
            Here you can search for a steam game, view it's current player count, and the latest news on the game.
            Currently the website only contains a small fraction of Steam's applist due to a full pull overloading the host service.
            To view the currently available/working games view the Games page by clicking on the word in the top right.
